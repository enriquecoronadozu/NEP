# Important:

This project is still in experimental steps, a first alpha version is expected to be launched next 15 of January of 2018. This new version comes with new interesting features in the end-user interface. Also some aditional features and improvements have been done in the freamework layer.

# NEP: An Open End-user Programming Platform for Social Robots.

Node primitives (NEP) is an open source experimental platform which allows the creation and design of social interactions with robots.

This platform have the next main characteristics:

- Cross-plataform: support Linux, Windows and OSX.
- Enables end-user and expert programming
- Ease to install
- Use ZeroMQ, nanomsg, "normal sockets" and ROS for inter-process comunication
- Mostly written in Python.
- Provides a End-User Programming interface for launching nodes and executing robot behaviors.
