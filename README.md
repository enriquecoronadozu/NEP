# NEP

Node Primitives (NEP) is a high-level library that provides simple and re-usable tools that enable the generation of software architectures for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and End-User Development (EUD).

NEP is mainly a inter-process communication library using sockets. NEP is back-ended by ROS, ROS 2.0 and expand capabilities of ZeroMQ and nanomsg to enable ROS-like features and cross-platform software architectures for robotics.

Deafult back-end implementation of NEP is ZeroMQ, which enable more user-friendly installation and provides better support for newer and older versions of most used desktop operating systems (Windows and MacOSX).
