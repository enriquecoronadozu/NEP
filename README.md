# NEP 

Node Primitives (NEP) is a high-level library that provides simple and re-usable tools that enable the generation of software architectures for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and End-User Development (EUD).

NEP is mainly an inter-process communication library using sockets. NEP is back-ended by ROS, ROS 2.0 and expands capabilities of ZeroMQ and nanomsg to enable ROS-like features and cross-platform software architectures for robotics.

The default back-end implementation of NEP is ZeroMQ, which enables more user-friendly installation and provides better support for newer and older versions of most used desktop operating systems (Windows and MacOSX).
