# # Aligment of datasets

# ## Descrption:
# 
# In this example we align and cut some set of fils with the data to be used to train gesture models

# Each training example must have the same number of samples for a specific gesture
# The we need to define the limits of the samples to be cutted

# This intruction save a cut the data.
# Also shows if the data is saved correctly, otherwise also shows what to do
